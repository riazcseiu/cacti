case object CacheBlockBytes extends Field[Int](64) //defination of blockbyte

1. Rocket core Configration Location 
src/main/scala/tile/L1Cache.scala

2.Defination is in the following link
src/main/scala/subsystem/Configs.scala
Parametter : 
   dcache = Some(DCacheParams(
        rowBits = site(SystemBusKey).beatBits,
        nSets = 64,
        nWays = 1,
        nTLBSets = 1,
        nTLBWays = 4,
        nMSHRs = 0,
        blockBytes = site(CacheBlockBytes))),
        
   icache = Some(ICacheParams(
        rowBits = site(SystemBusKey).beatBits,
        nSets = 64,
        nWays = 1,
        nTLBSets = 1,
        nTLBWays = 4,
        blockBytes = site(CacheBlockBytes))))
    List.tabulate(n)(i => med.copy(hartId = i + idOffset)) ++ prev

NSets and NWays defined in BaseConfig. You can change those numbers to get a Rocket core with different cache parameters. For example, by changing L1I, NWays to 4, you will get a 32KB 4-way set-associative L1 instruction cache rather than a 16KB 2-way set-associative L1 instruction cache.



but check this line where it's defined as 64 bytes. As an example, the configuration of L1 for TinyCore (If I'm right) it's:
D$ cache size = 256 nSets * 1 nWays * 64 CacheBlockbytes = 16384 Bytes = 16 KiB
I$ cache size = 64 nSets * 1 nWays * 64 CacheBlockbytes = 4096 Bytes = 4 KiB
...using the image below (different cfg) we can say that by default we have block size equals to 512-bit (64*8) instead of 32-bit like image.

Original README
==================================

A Tool to Model Caches/Memories, 3D stacking, and off-chip IO
-----------------------------------------------------------

CACTI is an analytical tool that takes a set of cache/memory para-
meters as input and calculates its access time, power, cycle 
time, and area.
CACTI was originally developed by Dr. Jouppi and Dr. Wilton
in 1993 and since then it has undergone six major 
revisions.

List of features (version 1-7):
===============================
The following is the list of features supported by the tool. 

* Power, delay, area, and cycle time model for 
                  direct mapped caches
                  set-associative caches
                  fully associative caches
                  Embedded DRAM memories
                  Commodity DRAM memories
                  
* Support for modeling multi-ported uniform cache access (UCA)
  and multi-banked, multi-ported non-uniform cache access (NUCA).

* Leakage power calculation that also considers the operating
  temperature of the cache.
  
* Router power model.

* Interconnect model with different delay, power, and area 
  properties including low-swing wire model.

* An interface to perform trade-off analysis involving power, delay,
  area, and bandwidth.

* All process specific values used by the tool are obtained
  from ITRS and currently, the tool supports 90nm, 65nm, 45nm, 
  and 32nm technology nodes.

* Chip IO model to calculate latency and energy for DDR bus. Users can model
  different loads (fan-outs) and evaluate the impact on frequency and energy.
  This model can be used to study LR-DIMMs, R-DIMMs, etc.

Version 7.0 is derived from 6.5 and merged with CACTI 3D. 
It has many new additions apart from code refinements and 
bug fixes: new IO model, 3D memory model, and power gating models.

     MemCAD: An Interconnect Exploratory Tool for Innovative Memories Beyond DDR4
     CACTI-3DD: Architecture-level modeling for 3D die-stacked DRAM main memory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 6.5 has a new c++ code base and includes numerous bug fixes.
CACTI 5.3 and 6.0 activate an entire row of mats to read/write a single
block of data. This technique improves reliability at the cost of  
power. CACTI 6.5 activates minimum number of mats just enough to retrieve 
a block to minimize power.

How to use the tool?
====================
Prior versions of CACTI take input parameters such as cache
size and technology node as a set of command line arguments. 
To avoid a long list of command line arguments, 
CACTI 6.5 & & let users specify their cache model in a more 
detailed manner by using a config file (cache.cfg).

-> define the cache model using cache.cfg
-> run the "cacti" binary <./cacti -infile cache.cfg>

CACTI also provides a command line interface similar to earlier versions. The command line interface can be used as

./cacti  cache_size line_size associativity rw_ports excl_read_ports excl_write_ports 
  single_ended_read_ports search_ports banks tech_node output_width specific_tag tag_width
  access_mode cache main_mem obj_func_delay obj_func_dynamic_power obj_func_leakage_power
  obj_func_cycle_time obj_func_area dev_func_delay dev_func_dynamic_power dev_func_leakage_power
  dev_func_area dev_func_cycle_time ed_ed2_none temp wt data_arr_ram_cell_tech_flavor_in
  data_arr_peri_global_tech_flavor_in tag_arr_ram_cell_tech_flavor_in tag_arr_peri_global_tech_flavor_in
  interconnect_projection_type_in wire_inside_mat_type_in wire_outside_mat_type_in
  REPEATERS_IN_HTREE_SEGMENTS_in VERTICAL_HTREE_WIRES_OVER_THE_ARRAY_in 
  BROADCAST_ADDR_DATAIN_OVER_VERTICAL_HTREES_in PAGE_SIZE_BITS_in BURST_LENGTH_in
